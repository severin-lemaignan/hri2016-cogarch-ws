## Support slides

To compile the slides, you need `lualatex` (included in all the major TeX distributions. On Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install texlive`).

A `Makefile` is provided for convenience: on Linux and MacOSX, enter each of the sub-directories, and simply type `make` from the command-line to compile the slides.
